Applications
==========

Applications are generally services that are packaged into a container image or
occasionally a virtual machine image if absolutely necessary and deployed using
Terraform. While the intent is that they would be deployed to a cluster based
on our [core](../core/README.md) image, in theory they should be possible to
deploy just about anywhere.
