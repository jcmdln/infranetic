This directory contains Terraform templates for various cloud providers with a
focus on providers that offer free accounts for testing purposes.

Note that we will attempt to outline all associated fees that are involved for
picking each provider, though be sure to fully audit any claims in our
documentation or actions performed by our Terraform templates before
assuming. We are not liable for any direct or indirect costs or undesired
actions incurred by using the contents of this directory or the accompanying
subdirectories.

If you want to test infranetic for free without ambiguity, consider testing
locally with Vagrant as outlined in the top-level [README](../README.md).
